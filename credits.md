### Art Credits

My profile portrait was drawn by [照宮テル](https://twitter.com/Tel0915).

The design of my persona is based on the original 3D model ["Youmei" by mofuaki](https://booth.pm/en/items/2599239), with additional clothing from the virtual fashion brand [Fika](https://fluffyscafe.booth.pm/); my modifications are done via Photoshop, GIMP, Blender, and Unity.

Chloe was designed in collaboration with sugoisuu, who did her initial visual design and drew her reference headshot. Chloe's reference sheet also contains art by [Murn](https://twitter.com/murninatair), and [Strovi](https://twitter.com/strovi_).

Sophia was designed in collaboration with Strovi, who did her initial visual design and drew her full reference sheet.

Chloe and Sophia's chibi artworks were drawn by [Punqakes](https://twitter.com/punqakes).

Thank you to all the wonderful and talented artists who have drawn my characters!
