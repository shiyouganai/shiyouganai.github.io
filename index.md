### About Me

Greetings, and thanks for visiting. I'm a full-time engineer and hobbyist game developer based in the United States, and I share my projects and various other online things under the aliases Priere and shiyouganai. You can find some of my latest fixations below!

### Miscellany

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiyouganai)  
  This is my public social media account, but advance warning: it's general purpose and has lots of non-programming content.
  
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/priere__)  
  This is where I sometimes stream my FFXIV gameplay.

* [FFXIV Character Profile](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10232780/)  
  [FFLogs Profile](https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/cactuar/priere%20d'enpa)  
  One of my hobbies is playing MMORPGs, and I've been an active FFXIV player for quite a few years. I'm linking my character information here because I'm always willing to say hello to a fellow player.
