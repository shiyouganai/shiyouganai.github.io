### About Me

Greetings, and thanks for visiting. I'm a full-time engineer and hobbyist developer based in the United States, and I share my projects and various other online things under the aliases Priere and shiyouganai. I love virtual reality, music, and crossword puzzles. You can find some of my latest fixations below!

**Priere** ([Reference Gallery](/gallery/priere-reference))  
My current mascot character/persona represents me all over the social internet, including in VRChat. He is a Kemono style fox; I really like that genre of artwork.
