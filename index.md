### About Me

Greetings, and thanks for visiting. I'm a full-time engineer and hobbyist developer based in the United States, and I share my projects and various other online things under the aliases Jay Priere and shiyouganai. I love virtual reality, music, and crossword puzzles. You can find some of my latest fixations below!
