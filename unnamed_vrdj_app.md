### Unnamed VR DJ App (In Development)
A collaboration with good friend [DJ School Pizza](https://twitter.com/djschoolpizza) and [Ravestation Records](https://twitter.com/ravestationrec); this is a custom Unity application for Virtual Reality DJ performances. It can capture the DJ's movements, emote the 3D avatar, play background videos, and more!

#### Performance VODs

Due to built-in art assets, this project's source and binaries will remain private. However, some VODs of performances using the app are below, ordered from most recent version to earliest version. The app has come a long way since we started development!
