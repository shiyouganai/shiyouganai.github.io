### Projects

#### Unnamed VR DJ App (In Development)
A collaboration with good friend [DJ School Pizza](https://twitter.com/djschoolpizza) and [Ravestation Records](https://twitter.com/ravestationrec); this is a custom Unity application for Virtual Reality DJ performances. It can capture the DJ's movements, emote the 3D avatar, play background videos, and more! Some VODs of performances using the app are below, ordered from most recent version to earliest version.

### Miscellany

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiyouganai)  
  This is my public social media account, but advance warning: it's general purpose and has lots of non-programming content.

* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/priere__)  
  This is where I sometimes stream my FFXIV gameplay.

* [Mascot](/assets/chloe_main_reference_2200x1600.png)  
  This website's mascot character is named Chloe, and here is her reference sheet! She also represents me as an avatar on some of my social media accounts, and sometimes in VRChat.

* [FFXIV Character Profile](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10232780/)  
  [FFLogs Profile](https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/cactuar/priere%20d'enpa)  
  One of my hobbies is playing MMORPGs, and I've been an active FFXIV player for quite a few years. I'm linking my character information here because I'm always willing to say hello to a fellow player.
